## About

> Like many software engineers, my life is a constant balancing act between hockey, filmmaking, family, and a never ending stream of ideas.

What? That's not how you imagine a software engineer spending his time? I guess that explains why nobody I've ever worked with likes to take breaks from coding to shoot hockey pucks...

I've always been motivated by hockey. The unique feeling I get when I score a goal, or pull off a sweet move, is something I continually strive for. That's why when I first discovered software development, designed my first website, and had that familiar feeling of accomplishment; I knew this was the industry for me.

Nowadays I'm lucky to be able to split my time between making YouTube videos with [@CoachJeremy](https://youtube.com/CoachJeremy), working on [The Pond](https://thepond.howtohockey.com), and building out my own portfolio of [software projects](https://github.com/HadenHiles).
